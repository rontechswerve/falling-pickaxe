.SYNOPSIS
    Sets up virtual environment and continuously runs the Python program located at ./src/main.py, restarting it upon exit.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script:
    1. Creates a virtual environment (.venv) if it doesn't exist
    2. Activates the virtual environment
    3. Installs dependencies from requirements.txt if needed
    4. Enters an infinite loop where it starts the specified Python program
    If the program exits, the script waits for 2 seconds and then restarts it.
    The loop can be interrupted by pressing Ctrl+C, which triggers the catch block to display a stop message and error details.

.NOTES
    - Requires Python to be installed and accessible via the "python" command.
    - Intended for streaming or testing scenarios where automatic restarts are useful.
    - Automatically manages virtual environment and dependencies.
