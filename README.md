## How to use it
*Update: You can watch my tutorial here: https://youtu.be/aFrvoFE7r_g*

### Quick Start (Recommended)
The easiest way to run the game is using the automated scripts that handle everything for you:

**For Windows:**
```
./scripts/run.ps1
```

**For Linux/macOS:**
```
chmod +x ./scripts/run.sh
./scripts/run.sh
```

These scripts will automatically:
- Create a Python virtual environment if it doesn't exist
- Install all required dependencies
- Run the game with automatic restart on crashes
- Exit cleanly when you close the game window

### Updating to the latest version
The scripts above will keep dependencies updated, but they **won't download new code for you**. To get the newest features and bug fixes:

1. If you cloned with Git, run:
   ```
   git pull
   ```
   Then re-run `./scripts/run.ps1` (Windows) or `./scripts/run.sh` (Linux/macOS). The scripts will reinstall any new dependencies automatically.
2. If you downloaded a ZIP, download the latest ZIP from GitHub again and replace your old folder, then run the script for your platform.

Your `config.json` will remain untouched, but if new settings are added they default to the values in `default.config.json`. Copy over new options as needed.

### Manual Setup (Advanced Users)
If you prefer to set up the environment manually:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. If you don't, follow the instructions from the official [python website](http://python.org/downloads/)
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Linux/macOS:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the game:
   ```
   python ./src/main.py
   ```

### Configuration (Optional)
1. Make a copy of `default.config.json` to `config.json` or run the game once to automatically copy the config file into `config.json`
2. Create your Google API Key for YouTube.
3. Enable the YouTube Data API v3 for your Google Cloud Project.
4. Enter your credentials in the configuration file.
5. Set your youtube channel id and livestream id in the configuration file.
6. Change configuration to your liking

**Note:** The automated scripts (`run.ps1` and `run.sh`) will run the game and restart it in case of unexpected crashes. When you close the game window normally, the script will exit cleanly. This is perfect for unattended streams.

Steps 2 to 6 are **optional**. You can disable the entire YouTube integration by setting the property: `"CHAT_CONTROL": false`

### Available chat commands
```
tnt

fast
slow

big

wood
stone
iron
gold
diamond
netherite
```

### MegaTNT spawning

Extra details about when a MegaTNT appears in the game:

- New subscribers are detected by periodically polling YouTube for the channel's subscriber count. When an increase is detected the game appends an entry to the `mega_tnt_queue` (the string `"New Subscriber"`) and the MegaTNT will be spawned when the queues are processed.
- Queue processing happens every `QUEUES_POP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (see `default.config.json` / `config.json`). Polling frequency for YouTube is controlled by `YT_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`.
- Requirements for automatic MegaTNT spawning: `CHAT_CONTROL` must be `true`, a valid `live_chat_id` and `CHANNEL_ID` must be configured so the game can read subscriber counts.
- The queued owner name is currently the literal string `"New Subscriber"` (not the subscriber's username). You can change this behavior in code if you want actual usernames used.
- You can also spawn a MegaTNT manually in-game by pressing the `M` key — this spawns immediately (no queue).
- MegaTNTs use a larger explosion radius, detonate automatically ~4 seconds after spawn, and trigger a stronger camera shake.
